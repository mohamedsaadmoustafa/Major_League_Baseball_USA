# Major League Baseball USA

## Introduction:
   • Applying data wrangling and exploratory data analysis skills 
     to baseball data. In particular, we want to know how well did Moneyball work for the 
     Oakland A's. Was it worthy of a movie?

## Dataset:
    • dataset here: http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2014.txt
    
## PART ONE: Data Wrangling:
    • use SQL to compute a relation containing the total payroll
      and winning percentage (number of wins/number of games * 100) for each team.
    • describe how to deal with any missing data in these two relations.

## PART TWO: Exploratory Data Analysis:
    • Payroll distribution
    • Correlation between payroll and winning percentage
    
    
 
## PART THREE: Data Transformations:
    • Standardizing across years
    • Expected wins
    • Spending efficiency
